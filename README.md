# Project: App Store Analysis for Successful App Launch

## Project Description

In this scenario, a prospective app developer has approached me to better understand the current landscape of the Apple App Store. ***Using mySQL***, I delved into the vast ecosystem of the App Store to better ***understand user reviews, ratings, and overall trends*** in apps and app categories. I conclude this project by providing ***6 data-supported insights***, along with an ***actionable recommendation*** to guide my client to a successful app launch.

## Insights and Recommendations

1) The ***‘Games’ and ‘Entertainment’*** categories have the highest volume of apps. This suggests both ***high competition*** and ***high user demand***. 
2) Existing ***‘Finance’ and ‘Book’ apps*** have the ***lowest average ratings***. This suggests that users are not satisfied, opening opportunities for ***market penetration***. 
3) Apps with ***longer descriptions*** tend to have ***higher ratings*** than those with shorter descriptions. 
4) ***Paid apps*** tend to have ***higher ratings*** than free apps, perhaps due to perceived value or increased engagement when one spends money on an app. 
5) There is no positive correlation between language availability and user ratings.
6) Average rating for an app in the App Store is 3.5 stars. 


Final Recommendations:
Though ‘Games’ and ‘Entertainment’ apps have proven to be more popular, ***I recommend diving into the untapped market of either ‘Finance’ or ‘Books’***. Still existing within the Top 10 app categories, these niches have sizable audiences that are clearly dissatisfied with the current offerings, suggesting ***increased opportunity for market penetration*** with a quality app. 

Once developed, I recommend spending time ***curating a well-crafted app description***, setting clear expectations and detailing all of the primary features of the app. Aim for anywhere between 10 and 30 supported languages as this language bucket has the highest average ratings, however, not much time needs to be spent on this aspect of the app as there is no clear correlation observed. Lastly, a goal of above 3.5 stars, the average rating for an app in the store, can be set in order to be considered a successful app launch.
